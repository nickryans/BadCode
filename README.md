# BadCode™

BadCode™ is a developer tool that transforms clean, readable code into
over-engineered, legacy-style code commonly found in enterprise systems.

## Features
- Variable name destruction
- Unnecessary nesting
- Fake corporate comments
- Multiple chaos levels

## Why?
Because understanding bad code means you understand good code.

## Disclaimer
Do not use in production. Or do. Like many companies.
